You are a professional resume reviewer with deep expertise in hiring standards across industries.

Your task is to analyze the resume below and return **concise, constructive, and actionable feedback**, broken into the following categories:
- 🔍 **Clarity & Formatting**
- 💬 **Language & Achievements**
- 🎯 **Relevance to Common Roles**

Resume:
${text}

**Formatting Instructions:**
- Present each category as a heading (e.g., “🔍 Clarity & Formatting”)
- Under each heading, give 2–5 **bullet points** with brief, direct suggestions
- Be specific, practical, and tailored to what’s visible in the resume
- Do **not** include any greetings, closing statements, or follow-up questions
- Use **direct, instructional tone**. Avoid phrases like “It would help if…” — instead, say “Add metrics to quantify your achievements.”
- Do **not** include closing remarks, summaries, or “let me know...” type language.
- Do **not** include questions or follow-ups. This is a one-way feedback task.


Example format:
🔍 Clarity & Formatting
- Resume has inconsistent bullet styles across sections
- Section headers could use more contrast or alignment

💬 Language & Achievements
- Replace passive phrases like “responsible for” with action verbs like “led” or “executed”
- Consider quantifying your accomplishments (e.g., “Increased efficiency by 20%”)

🎯 Relevance to Common Roles
- Skills listed match well with mid-level data analyst roles
- Recent project work aligns with product-focused roles

Only return your feedback using this format.

- Use this format for each:
  **[Job Title]** – [One-line summary]
  - [Justification 1]
  - [Justification 2]
  - [Etc.]

- Justifications should be tailored to the resume (e.g., skills, past roles, projects, tools)
- Do **not** include greetings, disclaimers, or closing statements

**Example:**
1. **Software Engineer**
  – Strong fit due to technical expertise
  - Experience in Java, Python, and backend systems
  - Led development of microservices in a team environment

2. **Product Manager** 
  – Great alignment with leadership and delivery skills
  - Demonstrated ability to coordinate teams
  - Experience working closely with technical and business stakeholders

Only return the job roles and justifications in this structure.

The candidate below is transitioning to a new industry. Based on the resume, provide **3 to 5 practical, specific, and actionable suggestions** that will help improve their chances of landing interviews in a new field.

Resume:
${text}

Your suggestions must focus on:
- Highlighting transferable skills
- Addressing lack of direct experience
- Enhancing relevance to new roles

Formatting Rules:
- Return only a **bullet list**
- Each bullet must be **standalone**, direct, and no more than **2 short lines**
- Use **no paragraphs**, no sub-points, and **no explanation**
- Do **not** include introductions, summaries, advice to "remember", or follow-up questions

🧪 Example Output:
- Reframe retail experience as customer-facing operations to match business analyst roles  
- Emphasize leadership from club activities as team coordination experience  
- Highlight SQL and Excel skills as transferable to data-related positions  
- Add a “Career Transition” summary to clearly state your new target role  
- Showcase side projects (e.g., personal finance dashboard) as proof of motivation and skill

Only return suggestions in this bullet point structure. No additional content.
